          A long-term, creative partnership that turns athletes into designers
        </h4>
      </div>
      <br />
      Regardless of their level, a football player's kit is about confidence as
      much as it's about performance. From junior to professional, it's your
      amour from self-doubt. A reminder that no matter where you are in the
      journey "from grassroots to greatness," you belong there. And yet, this
      critical step in preparing the team's next season has been surprisingly
      traditional.<br />Turning Athletes into Designers <br />The process began
      with one representative from the team meeting with a retailer armed with
      notes from players and management. This customer then explains what they
      are looking for, pointing to samples that are not quite right while
      flipping through a pile of catalogs the retailer offers. Hopefully, one of
      them is Nike.

      With a simplified customer-facing kit experience, we skipped photography
      and its limitations to embrace 3D models.<br />
      <h5>Moving away from the hassle of paper catalogues</h5>
      These clients had a clear idea of what they wanted but had no accurate way
      to capture and communicate it. To make matters worse, there were numerous
      ways their design could be misinterpreted. Teams would verbally describe
      how they wanted their kits to look and hoped that every person in the
      assembly chain would understand. Catalogue photography struggled to
      capture how material genuinely looked, leading to misaligned expectations
      for the final product. In the end, XX% of orders that did make it to Nike
      was returned for not matching the desired result.

      personalised for teams and tailored to the needs of the various different
      sports. The execution is incredibly strong, easy to use, clear UX, enough
      choice and the 3D visuals are just next level.’<br />Dutch Creativity

      <h5>Developing a powerful 3D tool</h5>
      <br />A software solution powerful enough to enable players and coaches to
      become designers, yet light enough to run from niketeamfootball.com, would
      be the single solution to a list of problems. With a simplified
      customer-facing kit experience, we skipped photography and its limitations
      to embrace 3D models. We required 3D models so precise that you could
      almost touch the material to avoid new wave returns. <br />
      In our search for the right partner, we met Smoke & Mirrors, specialists
      in scanning 3D fabrics. With a rig of 180 cameras capturing hi-res data
      where each final article of clothing, from shirts to socks, contained more
      than 2Gb. This method allowed for creating digital twins of Nike's
      materials, delivered in layers that enabled exceptionally flexible
      customization. <br />

      <h5>A solution build to scale that creates digital twins</h5>
      <br />With 40 individual colours, 20 unique jersey designs, we have given
      clients the power to control every variable. Adding up model choice,
      colour combination, and material selection provides thousands of options
      before you even get to team and sponsor logos with player names. Client
      accounts allow the designated designer to share the results with every
      team member before approaching a retailer. Consequently, the true-to-life
      renders dramatically reduced returns by a projected XX%. Likewise, it
      significantly reduced the workflow, removing the need to photograph every
      colour.  <br />
      For retailers, players and teams, it provides them with the latest Nike
      sport innovations and information. The simplified experience secures trust
      that players will receive precisely the kits they design. The signature
      Nike style for visuals means the kit configurator generates striking
      design assets that are applied throughout the customer journey—in social,
      shop experience, order confirmation and even aftercare.
